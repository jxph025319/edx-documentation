Making course videos available to as many learners as possible can be a complex
undertaking.

* Videos need to be available from more than one host site to play in locations
  around the world.
* Videos need to be available in several different formats to play on
  desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices.
* Videos need to be available for both download and streaming for learners with
  slow or intermittent Internet connections.

To reach as many learners as possible, we recommend that you post copies of
your videos in multiple formats and on more than one site.

.. important::
  After you post a video online, make sure you have the URL for that copy of
  the video. If you post copies of your video in more than one place, make sure
  you have the URL for each video location.

* Because the video player accesses YouTube videos by default, we
  recommend that you upload your videos to `YouTube`_.
* We recommend that you also post copies of your videos on a third-party
  hosting site such as `Amazon S3`_.

When a learner views a video in your course, if YouTube is not available in
that learner's location or if the YouTube video does not play, the video on the
backup site starts playing automatically. You can also allow the learners to
download the video from the backup site.

You can use any video backup site that you want. However, keep in mind that the
site where you post the videos might need to handle high traffic volume.

.. note::
 The URL for the video that you post on a third-party site must end in .mp4,
 .mpeg, .webm, or .ogg. (To help make sure all standard browsers can play your
 video, edX **strongly** recommends that you use .mp4 format.) The video player
 cannot support videos that you post on sites such as Vimeo.
